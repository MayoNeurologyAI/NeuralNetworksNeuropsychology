The user interface was built with the [svelte](https://svelte.dev) framework.

## Code description

All code is located in the 'src' folder.

### MplLayer
To understand and evalute the models, start with the `architecture` folder. All networks are composed of 2 or more `MplLayers`. MplLayers contain the code for defining weights and bias nodes, intializing, forward activation and weight adjustments. 

### MplNetwork
The MplNetwork class is an abstract class that defines how the MplLayers in the network interact. The MplNetwork class is declared in the `networks` folder. All networks, which define the layers and their interactions are also located in the `networks` folder.

The feed forward networks used in the paper's studies use the `HiddenLayerNetwork` class, while the mirrored cascaded networks use the `McnNetwork` class.

### Studies
All code directly related to managing studies is in the `study` folder. Single problem studies start with the `singleProblemStudy` function (in the `singleProblemStudy.ts` file) while multiple problem studies start with the `multiProblemStudy` function (in the `multiProblemStudy.ts` file).

The specific study parameters used for each study are located in the `defineStudies/np21` folder.

### Problem definitions
All problems are defined in the `trainingSets` folder.

### Svelte components
The UI was built using the [svelte](https://svelte.dev) framework. The launching component is `App.svelte` in the root directory. All other display components are in the `components` folder.
